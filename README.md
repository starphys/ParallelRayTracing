# ParallelRayTracing
Applying parallelization techniques to a ray tracer based on Ray Tracing in One Weekend by Peter Shirley

This was a semester long project for CS 159 at SJSU. The goal of the project was to learn the basics of C++ multithreading and CUDA, while brushing up on rendering fundamentals and object oriented design. Each version of the ray tracer lives in a separate branch in this repository, and can be compiled and run through Visual Studio. Setup steps for compiling the CUDA version can be found here: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit
